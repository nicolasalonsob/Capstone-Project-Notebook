For this, it is important to consider variables such as: competitors and possible buyers according to the population of the local neighborhood.\n\nGiven that there is a wide variety of stores throughout Toronto, the project will attempt to identify locations that are not as crowded with stores. Likewise, an attempt will be made to search for locations near the city center.\n\nTo achieve the objective of the project, data science will be used in order to generate possible neighborhoods based on the two criteria mentioned. In order that the individual who is going to make the investment in the store can more easily choose the ideal location, the advantages of each of the areas will be well defined.", "attachments": {}}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}

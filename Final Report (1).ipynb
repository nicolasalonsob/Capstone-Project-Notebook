For this, it is important to consider variables such as: competitors and possible buyers according to the population of the local neighborhood.\nGiven that there is a wide variety of stores throughout Toronto, the project will attempt to identify locations that are not as crowded with stores. Likewise, an attempt will be made to search for locations near the city center.\nTo achieve the objective of the project, data science will be used in order to generate possible neighborhoods based on the two criteria mentioned. In order that the individual who is going to make the investment in the store can more easily choose the ideal location, the advantages of each of the areas will be well defined.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\u00a0\nIn order to achieve the objective of the project, two sets of data described below will be used:\nFirst, the Toronto neighborhood profile will be used so that these census data can provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the households and people in the neighborhoods, in order to choose the best neighborhoods to place the stores. On the other hand, it is important to note that the profiles present selected highlights of the data, but these attachments provide the complete data set gathered for each neighborhood.\nIn the following link you will find the data mentioned above:\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\u00a0\"\nSecond, Foursquare data will be used to obtain information about the different stores in the city of Toronto\nIn the following link you can find the aforementioned data:\u00a0https://es.foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Toronto%2C%20ON%2C%20Canad%C3%A1&nearGeoId=72057594044095801&q=Compras\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Methodology\u00a0\nThe main moto of this project is to find best location to open a new store in Toronto, Canada based on competition in different locality and their population.\nSo, to do this I have used 2 different data sets available as mentioned above. Those 2 data set contains Locality information of Toronto, different age group of people in the people, population.\nTo solve the problem I am going to use \u201cK-Means Clustering Algorithm \". K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-means clustering algorithm are:\nThe centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster)\nAlso, I will be utilizing different maps in-order to give a clear vision to the target audience.\nSteps we took for the analysis:\n\u2022 Collected required **data: location and type (category) of every store within our lat and lng. We have also the type of stores in particular locality.\n\u2022 Explored the 'store density' across different areas of Toronto - we will use\u00a0K- mean\u00a0to identify a few promising areas close to center with low number of stores and their type.\nExplored the most promising areas and within those create\u00a0clusters of locations that meet some basic requirements\u00a0established in discussion with stakeholders: we will take into consideration locations with\u00a0less stores in radius of 500 meters, We will present map of all such locations but also create clusters (using\u00a0k-means clustering) of those locations to explore neighborhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Analysis\u00a0\nData identification, capturing and cleaning.\nSearch & Identify the relevant data source and capture it, here we are using Wikipedia to get data about Toronto, Canada. Then we remove all the redundant value(data cleaning). Then we combine neighborhood similar Bronx. Now the data is clean and ready to use.\nCombining different data source and sorting neighborhood based on Longitude and latitude\nNow, we will combine neighborhood dataset with postal address and dataset with Latitude & Longitude and save them it separate data frame. The resultant data frame with contain details about Postal code, Brough, Neighborhood, Latitude & Longitude. Then visualize it using folium map.\nExplore the Toronto's neighborhoods\nFirstly, we explored all the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto, using the Latitude & Longitude data, using Foresquare API to get the store venues available in Toronto. Explore the unique categories in the neighborhood. Filter the Venues details for all possible \u2018store\u2019. Find each neighborhood along with the top most common venues. Identify the top 10 venues for each neighborhood.\nClustering\nWith an assumption of 5 clusters, use K-Cluster algorithm to come up with 5 different clusters in Toronto with similar set of Venues. Explore each cluster and determine the discriminating venue categories that distinguish each cluster. Identify the clusters & Boroughs/Neighborhoods with Maximum number stores and their types.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Results and Discussion\u00a0\nOur analysis shows that although there is a great number of stores in Toronto, there are pockets of low store density fairly close to city center. We have 4 boroughs and 74 neighborhoods inside geographical coordinate of\u00a043.653963, -79.387207.\nBased on our initial assumption of the cluster with maximum number of stores will have the best possibility to have a new store due to the need in the area. Based on the resultant clusters it looks like Cluster 1 and Cluster 5 have higher number of stores then rest of the clusters.\nIt is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of store  in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new store regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Conclusion\u00a0\nPurpose of this project was to identify areas n Toronto with low number of stores in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new store. By calculating store density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis, and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby stores. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\nFinal decision on optimal store location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood etc."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
